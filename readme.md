# What is this?
## Description
I so much hate ad-bots in my telegram work chat's, so I decided to create this bot with something-like captcha.  
So, when a user joins the chat, bot immediately restrict it until forever and asks to confirm that it isn't a robot.  
If it's human, just need to click "I'm not a robot!". Then bot will delete his message and allow a user to write in the chat.  
If not, bot will wait for 48 hour's and then ban user account in that chat.
## How to use?
Add [@antibotuser_bot](https://t.me/antibotuser_bot) to chat/superchat and give it admin rights. Then bot will work as I intended.

## Note
I just started to test this bot, so feel free to send me reports and issuse here(github) or in [Telegram](https://t.me/ejnshtein).
